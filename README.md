# World-Electricity-Analysis

* Analysis of access to the electricity  based on different parameter as a function of time 
* getting meaningful insights of Electricity Production by different Sources (nuclear , oil , renewable) 
* transmission loss across the world and getting trends &amp; insights.



## DATA SOURCE üìä:
Extract the data from the world bank website in:

here the source of raw data: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.ELC.ACCS.ZS

## Built with üõ†Ô∏è:

* Python
* Sql
* Microsoft Excel



## How to run locally üõ†Ô∏è:

* Before the following steps make sure you have Anaconda or miniconda and sql data base installed on your system
* https://github.com/amitrr2po/World-Electricity-Analysis you can download the code and unzip it.
* if you take the data directly from the website cleanup or done EDA in the data set for further steps.
* after done aggerigation by help of sql and finding the insights.
* redirect to the excel platform for the data visualization and connect with sql so that if made any changes that will show or reflect on the dashboard directly.

## Further Improvements üìà

This is My first project so there is lot of things need to improvement
* Need to find more insights from the data.
* Making dashboard more interactive with adding more features.
* Made connection between python, sql and excel so that any changes will be recoreded.
